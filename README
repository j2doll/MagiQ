        <td>Widget</td>
        <td>Widget that lets you select an image.  
        Usage: construct the widget specifying as Orient argument the widget layout (orizontal, the default, or vertical).  
        Use the public function AggiungiImmagine to add images specifying, as arguments, the pixmap and the title of the image.  
        The function CancellaTutte will reset the widget to empty.  
        The function ImpostaPosDidascalia can be used to specify whether or not and where to display the image title.  
        The signal IndexChanged is emitted each time an image is selected.

        Sorry for the names being in italian but I just recycled this widget from a previous project.</td>
