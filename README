        <td>Widget that lets you select an image.<br />
        Usage: construct the widget specifying as Orient argument the widget layout (orizontal, the default, or vertical).<br />
        Use the public function AggiungiImmagine to add images specifying, as arguments, the pixmap and the title of the image.<br />
        The function CancellaTutte will reset the widget to empty.<br />
        The function ImpostaPosDidascalia can be used to specify whether or not and where to display the image title.<br />
        The signal IndexChanged is emitted each time an image is selected.
        <br />
        Sorry for the names being in italian but I just recycled this widget from a previous project.</td>
